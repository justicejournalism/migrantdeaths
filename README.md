This animated map tracks the death toll along the Arizona border from 2001 to 2013. In 2001, 79 deaths were reported. In 2013, there were 173.

The data is from the [Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants](http://humaneborders.info), a joint project of the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner and Humane Borders, a nonprofit that offers assistance to migrants through the deployment of emergency water stations on routes known to be used by migrants coming north through the desert.
